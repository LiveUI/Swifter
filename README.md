## Installation
Clone and run, it's not complicated at all :)

## Usage

In order to use `carthage` you need to have them installed on your system, same applies to any other functionality you may see on the screenshots but they won't show in the app :)

## Publishing on AppStore
Even though this is an MIT license, I would like to ask you to not to publish a copy on the Apple AppStore üçè as our copy is on the way there. Link will follow once approved.
