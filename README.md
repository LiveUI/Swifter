## Installation

Clone and run, it's not complicated at all :)

Although this app is using [`Cocoapods`](https://cocoapods.org), all has been check in so you shouldn't (in theory) need to run `pod install` at all. ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 

## Usage

In order to use `carthage` you need to have them installed on your system, same applies to any other functionality you may see on the screenshots but they won't show in the app :)

To make the app start with each login, open <b>System Preferences</b> -> Users & Groups -> Login Items -> + (Add an application to the list)
